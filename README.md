# Parquet Viewer
A very experimental, early stages Parquet Viewer using [Parquet.Net](https://github.com/aloneguid/parquet-dotnet) library. Works fully **offline** without internet connection. None of the files opened are uploaded anywhere.

Parquet Viewer works completely in browser as Web Assembly application.

Hosted at https://parquetdbg.aloneguid.uk/.
